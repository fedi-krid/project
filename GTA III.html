        As GTA 3 marks its 20th anniversary, Rockstar Games' parent company has revealed that more than 355 million GTA games have been sold across its entire history.

The figure comes from Take-Two Interactive Software's latest financial report, which dedicated a slide to the performance of the GTA series overall and GTA 5 and GTA Online in particular. While the series began in 1997 with the original Grand Theft Auto, the massive boost in popularity it received with the arrival of GTA 3 means the vast majority of those sales likely started from 2001 onward.
